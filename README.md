# Concurrent Hash Table

1. Coarse-grained hash table: Done
2. Fine-grained hash table: Done
3. Lock-free hash table: Not yet

TODO:
1. Write more test cases for hash tables.
2. Test their run time with read/write operations (some test cases are written in the test folder)
3. Implement lock-free hash table
